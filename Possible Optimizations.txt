Possible Optimizations:
(Note: more details TBA)

1. Tiling
Tiling can be done to reduce the number of slow global memory accesses during the stencil process. 
Tiling in the stencil algorithm is more effective the lower the order of the stencil. 
A larger input grid would increase the amount of data that is reused and increase the efficiency from tiling.

2. Thread coarsening
each thread in the GPU can perform one than one operation.
fewer threads means fewer scheduling and register overheads.
each threads do more work instead of stalling.

3> Register Tiling
load a small tile of data into registers.
achieve higher occupancy and instruction-level parallelism.
Registers are the fastest memory (faster than shared and global memory).
Minimizes memory accesses by reusing data.
