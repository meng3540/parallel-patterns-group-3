Possible Optimizations:
(Note: more details TBA)

1. Tiling
Tiling can be done to reduce the number of slow global memory accesses during the stencil process. 
Tiling in the stencil algorithm is more effective the lower the order of the stencil. 
A larger input grid would increase the amount of data that is reused and increase the efficiency from tiling.

2. Thread coarsening
Adjacent threads in a warp access adjacent memory address.
Contricbutes in reducing execution time by accessing adjacent data for stencil calculation.
