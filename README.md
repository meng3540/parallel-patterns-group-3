The organization of tasks with the objective to execute them simultaneously is called a parallel pattern in computing. This organization of task is called parallelism. These include:
Task Parallelism: different tasks or function run simultaneously, each doing a different job.
Data parallelism: The same task is performed on different pieces of data at the same time.
Pipeline Parallelism: Tasks are divided into stages, with each stage processing data and passing it to the next.
Divide and Conquer: A problem split into smaller parts, solved separately and combined.

Parallel patterns are significant because they help improve speed, efficiency and scalability of computing systems enabling multiple tasks to run at the simultaneously.
Operating Systems run multiple applications at the same time. (e.g. internet browsing, MP3 player and file download) is an example of task parallelism.
Graphics Processing/ GPR computing renders images and videos using thousands of parallel threads is a form of data parallelism.
An assembly line where multiple robotic arms perform different tasks such as in a car assembly station is a pipeline parallelism.
Detection of objects in images by breaking them into smaller regions demonstrates divide and conquer. 

Heterogeneous computing combines the advantages of both CPU and GPU to execute parallel computing patters. CPU excels in sequential processing and complex decision- making, while GPU excel at massively parallel workloads. This results in optimization of performance, reduce execution time and efficiently solve problems. 
The increase in performance by having GPU process large-scale parallel workloads while CPU processes complex logic make parallel computing very popular. It also creates resource utilization efficiency by balancing workload between serial and parallel execution. GPU complete parallel tasks faster with lower power consumption than CPUs making it energy efficient. It is also suitable for cloud computing, AI, scientific research and real-time applications.

Stencil Algorithm in Parallel Computing

Overview of the Stencil Pattern:
The stencil algorithm is a parallel computation pattern commonly used for problems that involve the manipulation of data over a grid or multi-dimensional array. The pattern gets its name from the concept of a "stencil," which is essentially a fixed shape or template that is applied repeatedly over a grid to compute new values based on neighboring elements.

In the stencil pattern, each grid point (or data element) is updated by combining values from its neighboring points. This is typically done in iterative steps, where each point in the grid updates its value using a combination of itself and its neighboring elements (in a defined neighborhood).

Applications:

Scientific simulations (e.g., weather modeling, fluid dynamics)
Image processing (e.g., edge detection, blurring filters)
Numerical methods (e.g., solving partial differential equations)
Finite difference methods for solving mathematical problems


Basic Algorithm:
The stencil algorithm works by applying a fixed template (or "stencil") to the grid at each step. This template defines which neighboring points influence the computation for each element.

Example: Consider a simple 2D stencil where each element in the grid updates based on the average of its 4 neighboring elements (up, down, left, right).

This stencil can be also be applied in 3 dimensions, following the same general pattern. The stencil algorithm is quite similar to convolution. According to Izzat El Hajj, the stencil algorithm is a special case of convolution.

Rationale for Using Parallel Processing:
The stencil pattern is a perfect candidate for parallel processing because the updates to each grid point are independent of each other (in terms of spatial locality). In other words, each point only depends on its immediate neighbors, which allows many points to be updated simultaneously in parallel. This parallelism speeds up the computation, especially when dealing with large grids or high-dimensional data sets.

Why use GPUs for Stencil Computation?

Massive Parallelism: GPUs have thousands of cores, making them ideal for running stencil algorithms where each element in a grid can be processed concurrently.
High Throughput: Stencil computations often involve large grids, and GPUs are optimized for handling large-scale data and performing operations on multiple elements in parallel.
Efficient Memory Access: GPUs can manage memory more efficiently, especially when accessing and updating neighboring elements in a stencil pattern, as they can use shared memory to minimize latency.


Conclusion:
The stencil pattern is a useful parallel computation method, especially when working with large grid-based datasets, such as in scientific simulations and image processing. By applying a fixed template (stencil) to grid points, the algorithm updates values based on neighboring elements. Parallel processing, especially on GPUs, accelerates these computations, making stencil algorithms highly efficient for large-scale problems that require repeated operations over large datasets.
